This is a little demonstration on how I think the theme should be structured.

As you see there are the files "event.php", "index.php" and "single.php" in the root dir AND in the markup dir.

The files in the root dir are only bridges. They decide if they should include header or not. And this are the files which will get used if you directly open an article url.

I think it's easy to understand - just take a look :)
